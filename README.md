This repository contains the code for a safety application designed to empower individuals to make smarter and safer decisions regarding mobility. The application consists of two branches: mapUI and DT.

MapUI branch:

The MapUI branch contains the website code for the map user interface. This interface allows users to view a heatmap of varying levels of safety in different locations within the city of Los Angeles. The heatmap is generated by a predictive neural network model, which takes into account historical crime statistics and a safety score generated by leveraging computer vision on street view images to account for several factors like illumination, the openness of the area, proximity to security, presence of public transportation, etc.

DT branch:

The DT branch contains the machine learning predictive model code. This model is used to cluster the geography of a certain city into a heatmap of varying levels of safety. The model uses mathematical models to account for several factors that contribute to the safety of an area.

In addition, the application includes an algorithm that finds "safe spots" based on a user's coordinates. It maps out the fastest path to each safe spot and computes the risk associated with each safe spot, so that a user can make an educated decision in case they find themselves in an unsafe location.

Finally, a chatbot is included in the application, which provides a crowdsourcing platform where users can submit information about how safe they feel in a particular location based on pre-defined factors. This information is used to further improve the predictive model's accuracy.

Overall, this application aims to provide a comprehensive solution to the safety concerns of people traveling or moving to a new city. It provides users with access to reliable information about the safety of different locations and helps them make informed decisions about their mobility.
